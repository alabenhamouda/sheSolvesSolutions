# Meriem's Magic:

## idea

the problem consists of finding k primes such that their sum equals n
where 2<=k<=1000 and 4<=N<=2500 and by using the goldbach's conjecture.

### Case 1: **n is even**

we can substract k-2 twos from it and then we look for two
primes that sum to n-(k-2)\*2 (which is an even number).
if n-(k-2)\*2<4 then we print impossible
for example for n=70 and k=7
n=2+2+2+2+2+7+53
for n=1000 and k=501 we print impossible

### Case 2: **n is odd and k>=3**

we substract 3 from n now n-3 is even
and now we look for k-1 primes that sum to n-3 with the same steps from case 1

### Case 3: **n is odd and k=2**

n=p1+p2 where p1 and p2 are primes and their
sum now is odd. this can only happen when one of them is even
and the only even prime is 2 so we have to verify if n-2 is prime
if yes then p1=2 p2=n-2

## implementation

under our constraints solutions having up to O($n^2$) will be accepted

### filling array with primes up to n

we can check every number from 1 to n  if it's prime or not in O($n^2$)  

we can use the sieve of erasthones algorithm to improve the efficiency to O(nlog(log(n))) which is practically the same as O(n)
for filling an array with primes up to n  

### finding two pointers that sum to n

to find the primes we can use:
    -nested for loops :O($n^2$)
    -sets : O(nlogn)
    -twopointers :O(n)

and hence our best algorithm can have up to O(n log(log(n)))  
which is practiacally O(n)
